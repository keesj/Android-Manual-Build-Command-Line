Example of creating an executable for android
Just bare bones (no jni/Android) If you want native activities or understand binder and such have a good look at https://github.com/keesj/Android-HelloWorldService


Building:
call ndk-build from this directory
adb push lib/main /data/

Debug:
install gdb-multiarch
adb forward tcp:1235 tcp:1234
